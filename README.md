# Musekit

[![Android CI](https://github.com/Kwasow/Musekit/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kwasow/Musekit/actions/workflows/android.yml)

The app aims at providing a simple tool for musicians for free, without
disturbing ads and unnecessary features.

The main features are a tuning fork and a metronome, with more possibly
being added later on.
